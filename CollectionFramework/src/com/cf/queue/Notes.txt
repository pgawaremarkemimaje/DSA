Queue:
    - Queue is an interface in java.util package.
    - Queue is a child interface of Collection.
    - Queue is used to store multiple elements before processing.
    - Queue is used to store elements in FIFO (First In First Out) order.
    - Queue is implemented by LinkedList, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, etc.
    - Queue interface contains 6 methods
        1. add(Object o) - to insert an element
        2. offer(Object o) - to insert an element
        3. remove() - to remove an element
        4. poll() - to remove an element
        5. element() - to get the head element
        6. peek() - to get the head element

    - add(Object o)
        - insert an element
        - throw IllegalStateException if queue is full
        - throw NullPointerException if element is null
        - return true if element is inserted successfully
        - return false if element is not inserted successfully

    - offer(Object o)
        - insert an element
        - return true if element is inserted successfully
        - return false if element is not inserted successfully

    - remove()
        - remove the head element
        - throw NoSuchElementException if queue is empty
        - return the head element

    - poll()
        - remove the head element
        - return the head element
        - return null if queue is empty

    - element()
        - return the head element
        - throw NoSuchElementException if queue is empty

    - peek()
        - return the head element
        - return null if queue is empty


    - Since, Queue is interface, it is implemented by LinkedList, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, ArrayBlockingQueue, etc.
    - PriorityQueue is an unbounded queue based on a priority heap.
    - PriorityQueue is implemented by PriorityQueue class.
    - PriorityQueue is not synchronized.
    - PriorityQueue is not thread safe.
    - PriorityQueue is not ordered.
    - PriorityQueue is not sorted.
    - PriorityQueue is not null allowed.
    - PriorityQueue is not capacity restricted.
    - PriorityQueue is not resizable.
